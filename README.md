<h1> Repo to play with data science </h1>

<p> In this repository, I will do data analysis based on my own steam statistics in Counter Strike: Global Offensive.</p>

<p><b>To get your own statistics, provide informations in data_gathering/data_files/input.json:</b><br>
1. steamid, which can be found here: https://steamid.pro/ <br>
2. steam web api key, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey <br>
3. appid, which for cs:go is 730 by default, but feel free to experiment.<br>
Change it to 440 for Team Fortress 2 data

<h2> WARNING: Changing appid might work to gather the data,
 but it's completely random what will happen,
 if you try to process it!<br></h2>
</p>

<p>
Result is stored in JSON format.
